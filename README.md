# Project approach

This project was not only way to display my ability to build a Full Stack application with React and Node while showing how I approach problems but also a way to show myself with some honest realism where I am and where I need to get to. Going into this project I had worked in a full stack MERN application at my first developer job in a mostly frontend capacity a couple years ago. I went back into React learning some new things and using any resource I could find to help me set up my application. I tried to keep things simple since I was re-familiarizing myself with React again and decided to keep the main functionality within the main component so I could see everything connecting. I wanted to try useState hooks which had not come out when I was at my previous job. Using what I could remember from my time working in React and learning new ways to do things I was able to come up with ways to create solutions for the challenges. I was able to figure things out as I went along and if I could do it again I would have used more separate components to handle the individual functionalies such as adding a new company, or updating an existing company. I found that I was taking a little long to get sections done and didn't want to take up any more time so I'm submitting what I have now. With more time I would clean up the visuals for a smoother UX and cleaner UI. I would also build more robust state managment to deal with the creating and editing popups without bugs and make the actual cards look nicer than they are. I would also like to write more tests. I honestly haven't much experience writing tests and need to get that up to par. I also think that I could greatly simplify things structure-wise by dividing up functionality into reusable components such as an Add Company component and Edit Company component. I think I spent too much time on jumping around to different parts of the application to fix small things instead of focusing on one important thing at a time until that was solved. Overall this challenge helped me see where I can improve on my understanding of React, Node, relational databases, and overall fullstack architecture.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `nodemon`

Runs the server to connect to the mySQL database
Using the terminal navigate to 'server' folder
npm install nodemon or yarn add nodemon
Run command 'nodemon' to start server

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
